# The Vibecoder's Guide to the Galaxy

> **Game title:** The Vibecoder's Guide to the Galaxy.
> **Submission target:** Cursor Vibe Jam 2026.
> **Repo:** https://github.com/BYGGOLDENSTONE/vibe-raiders
> **Status:** Wave 4 fully complete (A through E). Economy rebalanced (single-planet peak ~350/s instead of ~5.7M/s), drone metric chip surfaces what those upgrades do, fresh saves require a homeworld claim from galaxy view, and the Moon Outpost flag prompts a moon-pick. Save key v6. Multiplayer (W6), System Expansion claim flow (W5), and Wormhole rift (W7) still pending.

## Project direction

**Incremental space empire — multiplayer.**

The galaxy from Wave 1 is the playable map. Wave 2 layered the resource economy and upgrade tree on top. Future waves add planet-surface visuals, system expansion, and the PartyKit relay so other players' empires become visible.

---

## What's done

### Wave 1 — galaxy simulation (carry-over)
A 3-layer procedural galaxy:
1. **Galaxy layer** — ~200 star systems on spiral arms around a supermassive black hole.
2. **System layer** — fly into a system; planets orbit the star with rings, moons, orbit lines.
3. **Planet layer** — focus on a planet; its moons orbit it, sibling planets remain visible.

All bodies are procedural — no textures, no external assets. GLSL fragment shaders for planets, stars, moons, accretion disk, nebula skydome. Full reference in **`docs/GALAXY.md`**.

### Wave 2 — empire foundation (this session)

Gameplay layer that sits on top of the galaxy view:

- **Seven resources, 1:1 with planet types**: Metal (rocky), Water (ocean), Gas (gas), Crystal (ice), Plasma (lava), Silicon (desert), Chemical (toxic). Same global pool for every player; you only earn a resource if you own a planet of that type, so player must spread to access all of them.
- **Top resource HUD**: single straight row of compact chips (`[●] METAL 153 +0.8/s`), seven total + an `Upgrades` launcher button. Locked resources show `—`. Lives top-center, below the layer switcher.
- **Skill-tree modal** (`▦ Upgrades` button → full-screen overlay):
  - ~150 nodes laid out on a 140 px grid, edges drawn as straight or L-shaped SVG paths (no curves, no diagonals).
  - **CORE** node at origin, always owned.
  - **Up column**: Expansion (Moon → Elevator → Shipyard → System Expansion → Wormhole Observatory → Transit → Trade Hub).
  - **East half**: 7 mining lanes + 7 optimisation rows, alternating above and below row 0 so resource lanes are interleaved instead of stacked as one block.
  - **West half**: 10 chains of logistics, drones, and tech mixed across rows. Tech chains have **cross-category prereqs** (Industrial Doctrine ← Storage Bays II, Storage Doctrine ← Refinery II, Swarm Doctrine ← Drone Fleet III, Quantum Compute ← Drone Engines II) so the tree feels woven, not striped.
  - Modal is pannable with mouse drag (capture only acquires after >4 px movement so node clicks aren't swallowed). Esc / backdrop click / × closes.
- **Tick** runs every render frame, dt-driven. Trickle of `0.8/s` per owned producing planet so the very first upgrade is reachable in ~10 s.
- **Deterministic starting planet**: scans the galaxy for habitable + moon-bearing worlds and picks the best (ocean+temperate > rocky+temperate > rocky+any). Persisted across reloads.
- **Save/load**: `localStorage` under `vibecoder.empire.v3`. Empire auto-saves every 5 s of wall clock and on every purchase. No offline progress.
- **Detail panel** lives on the right (top: 132 px so it doesn't collide with the HUD). The old bottom-left "planets in system" list was removed — clicking labels and the system view itself already does that job.

### Wave 2.5 — upgrade panel redesign (this session)

The pannable skill-tree canvas was scrapped in favour of a **Branch Browser** modal. Driven by a Claude Design handoff (`Galaxy Upgrade Tree.html` prototype): the user explicitly preferred the Browser layout over the constellation/orrery alternatives.

- **Left rail**: chains grouped under category headers (Expansion → Production → Drones → Logistics → Tech). Each chain row shows a coloured progress bar, name, `owned/total`, and a pulsing dot when a tier is buyable. Click selects the chain — no panning, no zoom.
- **Right detail pane**: chain header (icon, eyebrow, description, Progress / Next tier / ETA stats) above a vertical list of tier cards. Each card has the tier glyph, effect, cost pills (`have/need`, green when affordable, red when short), and a `Buy` button. Locked tiers show ETA or `Locked`; owned tiers show `✓ Owned` and an `Active` badge.
- **Buy VFX** (`src/empire/vfx.ts`): on click, drain particles fly from each consumed HUD chip toward the buy button (the chips also shake + tint with `--c`), then 280 ms later the actual `empire.buy()` lands and a burst (radial sparks, ring shockwave, soft flash, 18 dots) plus a floating `UNLOCKED` label fires at the button. The tier card flashes with a category-coloured glow. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **HUD chips** carry `data-resource="<key>"` so VFX can target them.
- **Modal** still keyboard-friendly: Esc closes, backdrop click closes, × button closes. Scroll inside the rail and detail pane independently.
- **Deleted**: `em-tree-*`, `em-node-*` styles + the panning logic. `panel.ts` is now ~290 lines without any drag/pan code.

### Wave 3 — planet-surface visuals (this session)

Owned home planet now reads as an active industrial world rather than a bare procedural sphere:

- **Factories** (`src/empire/surface.ts`) — 3 baseline + 1 per unlocked mining-rate tier for the planet's resource (cap 9). Procedural towers (BoxGeometry body + cap + antenna), oriented to the surface normal so they stand upright wherever they land. Cap colour matches the resource's HUD chip. Bodies live under `planet.body`, so they rotate with the axial spin like the rest of the planet.
- **Drones** — `8 + 6 × drone-count level` (so the swarm reads as dense even at level 0). Each drone slerp-interpolates between two random factory anchors with a sine-loft so paths arc above the surface. Speed scales with `metrics.droneSpeed`. `MeshBasicMaterial` + additive blending gives an emissive look without needing extra lights.
- **Deterministic placement** — factory positions come from a Fibonacci spiral seeded by `hash(planet.id + '|surface')`, jittered by RNG so the same planet always produces the same skyline.
- **Lifecycle** (`app.ts`) — `rebuildSurfaceIfNeeded()` runs on construction and on every `empire.subscribe` emit, but cheap-skips when both `factoryCount` and `droneCount` are unchanged (no GC churn from unrelated purchases). `disposeSurface` drops geometries/materials when rebuilding.
- **Tick** — `updateSurface(handle, dt, metrics)` advances drone `t` parameters in the main render loop. ~30 drones × tiny sphere mesh, no perf concern.

### Wave 4-C/D/E — balance pass + claim flows (this session)

The previous balance let a single planet hit ~5.7 M/s metal once drone upgrades stacked, because (count × cargoMul × speedMul) compounded multiplicatively. The W4-C pass flattens the drone formula and reduces tier values across the board. W4-D and W4-E added the missing player-choice moments (homeworld pick, moon pick).

**Balance pass (W4-C):**

- `docs/balance.csv` is the source-of-truth — every chain's old vs new tier values, plus the diagnosis of where the multiplier explosion came from.
- `droneThroughput` is now **additive**: `1 + 0.05*N + cargoAdd + speedAdd` instead of `(1 + 0.05*N) × cargoMul × speedMul`. Max throughput went from ×4900 to ~×7-8.
- `PROD_MUL_PER_TIER` reduced from `[0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00, 8.00]` (sum 15.75) to `[0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00]` (sum 2.8 = ×3.8 max).
- Refinery + Industrial Doctrine (global-mul): max combined +140% (was +1820%).
- Drone Cargo + Auto-Sort (drone-cargo): max combined +200% (was +2790%).
- Drone Engines + Quantum Compute (drone-speed): max combined +160% (was +2135%).
- Drone Fleet + Swarm Doctrine (drone-count): cap 34 drones (was 119).
- Storage Bays reduced; Storage Doctrine kept (storage = ceiling, not a rate multiplier — can't compound).
- Milestone costs unchanged. Trade Hub @ 50M is still endgame; only reachable via T2-system ×100 boost (which is wired in `claimedSystems` but the claim flow itself comes in W5/W7).
- `BASE_STORAGE_CAP`: 1000 → 1500 so Phase 3 (Space Elevator @ 1500 metal) fits at base.
- New peak rates: ~350/s metal on a fully-maxed single planet, ~2300/s on a fully-claimed home system, ~35,000/s once a T2 system is claimed.
- HUD: a new `em-chip-drones` summary chip shows `Drones: N · ×throughput` so the player can read upgrade impact without diving into the panel. Hidden until homeworld claim.

**Starting homeworld claim (W4-D):**

- Fresh saves now start with `homeClaimed: false`, `ownedPlanets: []`, `homeSystemId: ''`. The empire layer is dormant — no income, no upgrade panel button (HUD `display: none`), no HOME jump button.
- Galaxy/system/planet views all show a sticky `gx-banner` instructing the player: "Choose your homeworld — open a system and click a rocky planet (with moons) to claim it."
- Eligible planets get a `✦ CLAIM ·` prefix on their label with a pulsing border so they read as actionable from system view. `Empire.isHomeworldEligible(planet)` enforces the rule (rocky + ≥1 moon) — kept identical to the old auto-pick filter so the catalogue's metal+water-baseline assumption still holds.
- Planet panel renders a "★ Claim as Homeworld" button when applicable. Click → `Empire.claimHomeworld(planetId)` → state populated → camera flies to the freshly claimed planet → banner clears → HUD/upgrade panel activate.
- Replaces the deterministic `pickStartingPlanet` (deleted). Reset via Debug panel goes back to the claim flow.

**Moon outpost claim (W4-E):**

- Old: every moon of every owned planet auto-contributed +5/s crystal as soon as `moon-outpost` was bought, and the dome rendered on the geometric "primary moon" without input.
- New: `EmpireState.outpostMoonId` starts null. After buying Moon Outpost, the banner switches to "Pick an outpost moon — open your home planet view and click one of its moons." The home planet's moon labels gain `◌ pick · ` prefix and pulse.
- Moon clicks (via label) only fire the claim while `Empire.needsOutpostMoonChoice()` is true — `Empire.claimOutpostMoon(moonId)` validates (must belong to an owned planet) and sets the field. Re-clicking another moon moves the outpost.
- Income now comes only from the **chosen moon**, scaled by its system tier — `MOON_OUTPOST_INCOME.rate × tierMul`. The previous "all moons of all owned planets" formula was a hidden multiplier (15+ moons in late game = +75/s base × tier) and contributed to the rate explosion.
- `moon-outpost.ts` no longer picks a primary moon — `makeMoonOutpost` takes a `MoonHandle` directly. The host (`app.ts`) resolves it from `outpostMoonContext()` and rebuilds when the chosen moon changes.

**Files touched:** `docs/balance.csv` (new), `src/empire/types.ts` (state fields, save key v6, BASE_STORAGE_CAP), `src/empire/upgrades.ts` (rebalanced tier values), `src/empire/empire.ts` (formula change, `claimHomeworld`, `claimOutpostMoon`, `outpostMoonContext`, empty-state init), `src/empire/moon-outpost.ts` (chosen-moon signature), `src/empire/hud.ts` (drone chip + claim-gated visibility), `src/empire/debug.ts` (reset copy), `src/galaxy/ui.ts` (`EmpireCtx`, banner, claim button), `src/galaxy/labels.ts` (eligibility / pending-moon markers), `src/galaxy/app.ts` (claim wiring + label moon clicks), `src/style.css` (banner, claim button, drone chip).

### Wave 4-B — moon outpost + space elevator visuals (previous session)

When the player unlocks `moon-outpost` (and later `space-elevator`), the home planet's primary moon (smallest orbit radius) gets new artefacts:

- **Dome** (`src/empire/moon-outpost.ts`) — emissive crystal-coloured half-sphere with a dark base ring and a thin antenna, parented to `moon.mesh`. Sized in unit space (dome radius `0.25 × moon-mesh scale`) so the moon's existing `mesh.scale = data.radius` propagates the right world size. Sits at the moon's "north pole" relative to its mesh local Y.
- **Tether** — added when `space-elevator` unlocks. Unit-height `CylinderGeometry` (radius `0.012 × planet.radius`, additive emissive crystal cyan) parented to `planet.pivot` (no axial spin). Each frame, the moon's world position is converted into the planet pivot's local frame; the cylinder is positioned at the midpoint, scaled along Y to the distance, and rotated from `+Y` to the endpoint direction with a quaternion. No geometry rebuilds, just transform tweaks.
- **Shuttles** — 3 small additive spheres lerping along the tether between planet centre (`t=0`) and moon (`t=1`), bouncing back at the endpoints. Speeds and starting phases are spaced so they read as continuous traffic.
- **Lifecycle** (`app.ts`) — `rebuildMoonOutpostIfNeeded` mirrors `rebuildSurfaceIfNeeded`: cheap-skips when the unlock flags and home planet are unchanged, dispose+rebuild otherwise. Tether path appears the moment `space-elevator` is purchased without tearing the dome down.
- **Perf gate** — render loop sets `setMoonOutpostVisible(handle, state.systemId === homeSystemId)` every frame. In galaxy view or any other system view, both the dome group (under `moon.mesh`) and tether group (under `planet.pivot`) are hidden, and `updateMoonOutpost` early-returns so per-frame matrix work is skipped. Surface (factories/drones) is left always-visible since it's tied to mining tiers; W4-B's perf concession applies only to the new artefacts as the user requested.

### Wave 4-A — economy rewrite (previous session)

The single-resource progression deadlock and a flat trickle-driven economy were both replaced with a layered, planet-anchored model:

- **Per-planet income** (`PLANET_INCOME` table in `src/empire/types.ts`) — every owned planet contributes a primary + secondary stream (e.g. rocky → 3/s metal + 1.5/s water, ocean → 3/s water + 1.5/s gas, …). Resources you don't own a producing planet for stay at zero — no universal trickle.
- **Moon outposts** (Phase 2 `moon-outpost` unlock) — each owned planet's moons each add +5/s crystal. So a rocky home with 1-3 moons drips crystal as soon as Phase 2 lands, opening the cost lane for Phase 3+.
- **Planet-count synergy** — every owned planet adds +20% to a global multiplier (compound). 7-planet full home system → ×3.4 global from synergy alone.
- **System-tier multiplier** — `SYSTEM_TIER_BASE = 100`, applied per-system: home is T1 (×1), wormhole-claimed systems are T2 (×100), T3 (×10K), T4 (×1M). Stored as `claimedSystems: Record<systemId, tier>` on `EmpireState`. The home system is implicitly T1; the rest is hooked up but no second system claim path exists yet.
- **Rocky-only home start** (`pickStartingPlanet`) — every player begins with a rocky+moon planet so the cost catalogue can assume `metal + water` as the baseline currency. Removes the "ocean home → can't afford metal milestones" dead-end the old picker created.
- **Tiered cost shape** (`tieredCost` helper) — Tier I-III of every west chain (Storage Bays, Drone Fleet, Refinery, Auto-Sort, Drone Engines, Drone Cargo, plus all four Tech doctrines) costs **metal + water** only. Tier IV-VI mix in **crystal** — by then the player has bought Phase 2 / Moon Outpost, so crystal is flowing.
- **Milestone costs** — Phase 2 (Moon) costs metal+water, Phase 3-6 add crystal, Phase 7 (Wormhole Transit) is in millions of M+W+C, Phase 8 (Trade Hub) is the only step that requires the full 7-resource set (50M-10M each — by then the player has wormhole'd to a T2 system that produces other types).
- **Production chains rewrite** — the flat `rate-add` mining chain was deleted. Each resource now has a single `rate-mul` chain (Metal Refinery, Water Pumping, Gas Compression, Crystal Lab, Plasma Extraction, Silicon Works, Chemical Plant), tier values bumped to **+25/50/100/200/400/800%**. Planet income is the flat baseline; upgrades are pure boost.
- **Upgrade boost rebalance** — global-mul tiers max +400% (×6.3), drone-count tiers add up to 18 each, drone-speed/cargo max ×6.6 / ×9.6, Storage Doctrine tier VI is +10,000,000% capacity (×100,001 cap) so big numbers don't truncate at the storage ceiling. Base storage cap also bumped from 200 → 1000.
- **Bug fix** — `blendedCost(p, pb, p, 0, …)` (used by Metal Refinery) was overwriting the primary cost with the secondary's `0`. Now guarded so `sb=0` is a no-op.
- **HOME UX** — top-right gold pill button (`gx-home-btn`) jumps the camera to the home planet from any view (smooth, via the existing `navigateTo` + `CameraController` transition). Home planet's label gets a `★ HOME · ` prefix; home system's label gets `★ HOME · ` (or `★★ HOME SYSTEM · ` if every planet in the system is owned). Other owned planets get a `✓ ` prefix. Breadcrumb mirrors the same star markers. Driven by `LabelManager.markHome` + `UI.setHomeContext`, refreshed on every empire emit.
- **Save key bumped to v5** — old saves (v3, v4) auto-discard so every player picks up the new rocky home and the new economy. State now persists `claimedSystems`.

### Known issue — solved

The "single-resource progression deadlock" from W3 is gone:
- Every player starts rocky → has metal+water from second one.
- Every Tier I-III west chain costs only metal+water.
- Phase 2 (Moon) costs only metal+water and unlocks crystal income.
- Phase 3+ adds crystal to costs, with crystal already arriving from moons.

## Locked tech rules

- **3D** — Three.js (WebGL only, no WebGPU). 100% procedural — NO Blender / external assets / textures. Geometry + shaders + lighting only.
- **Multiplayer** — PartyKit relay (Cloudflare Workers). Single shared room, ≤16 players. (Not wired yet.)
- **Bundler** — Vite + TypeScript (strict, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `noUnused*`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`).
- **Mandatory widget** — `<script async src="https://vibej.am/2026/widget.js"></script>` in `index.html`. Do not remove.
- **Public repo, commits land on `main`.**
- **Instant-load** — no loading screens, no asset downloads. Audio (when added) must be WebAudio synthesized.
- **90% AI** — gameplay logic written by Claude under user direction.
- **Language** — all docs, code comments, commit messages, and runtime UI strings are English. Any Turkish strings still present are interim.

## Open work — wave roadmap

| Wave | Goal |
|---|---|
| **W3** | ✅ Complete. Procedural factory meshes + drone swarm on home planet. System-view emissive glow / connection lines deferred to W5 once multi-planet ownership exists. |
| **W4-A** | ✅ Complete. Economy rewrite (planet income, synergy, system tier, rocky-only home, cost rebalance) + HOME button + label markers. |
| **W4-B** | ✅ Complete. Dome + tether + shuttles on the chosen outpost moon. Visibility gated to the home-system view. |
| **W4-C** | ✅ Complete. Balance pass — droneThroughput formula now additive (was multiplicative compound), tier values reduced ~4×, drone HUD chip added. Single-planet peak ~350/s instead of ~5.7M/s. Driven by `docs/balance.csv`. |
| **W4-D** | ✅ Complete. Starting homeworld claim flow — fresh saves start dormant; player picks a rocky+moon planet from galaxy/system view via the panel button. Eligible planets pulse in labels. |
| **W4-E** | ✅ Complete. Moon outpost claim flow — Moon Outpost unlock now prompts the player to click a moon; only the chosen moon contributes income and renders the dome/tether. |
| **W5** | System Expansion mechanic — `system-expansion` unlock currently just sets a flag; needs UI to claim other planets in the home system, then per-claim resource stream addition. Cumulative income jump (the planned "binler/onbinler" curve) lands here. |
| **W6** | PartyKit relay — replicate each player's public empire state (claimed system, owned planets, owned upgrades). Other players' systems show their progress visually. |
| **W7** | Wormhole transit — claim a second system at T2 (×100 multiplier already wired in `claimedSystems`), visualised by a wormhole rift between systems. Trade Hub for inter-player resource swaps. |

Tunables for ongoing balance: see `docs/balance.csv` for the full audit. Live constants: `PLANET_INCOME`, `SYNERGY_PER_PLANET = 0.2`, `SYSTEM_TIER_BASE = 100`, `MOON_OUTPOST_INCOME = 5/s crystal`, `BASE_STORAGE_CAP = 1500`, `PROD_MUL_PER_TIER`, milestone costs in `src/empire/upgrades.ts` `expSteps`. Wave 4-B visuals: `DOME_DIAMETER_FRAC`, `TETHER_RADIUS_FRAC`, `SHUTTLE_COUNT`, `SHUTTLE_BASE_SPEED` in `src/empire/moon-outpost.ts`.

## Workflow notes

- User is non-technical — explain WHAT and WHY, not code internals.
- Plan before implementing; wait for user confirmation before each phase.
- Commit only when user explicitly approves.
- Update this file after each completed phase so future sessions can resume.
- Storage keys to know: `vibecoder.empire.v6` (full empire state — bumped this session for the homeClaimed + outpostMoonId fields and the balance pass; old v5 saves auto-discard), `vibecoder.empire.panelWidth.v2` (legacy panel width — unused after W2 redesign, can be deleted).
